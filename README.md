## Project for the Information Retrieval Course:
- #### Create a Vectore Space model for the documents of a given corpus
- #### The Information Retrieval System must respond to free-form queries using the Vector Space model
- #### Implement a ChampionList index
- #### Implement a proper Relevance Feedback method to modify the results of a query
- #### Implement a Pseudo-Relevance Feedback method to modify the results of a query

### Informations about the corpus:
- #### ~44000 documents
- #### ~ 300000 terms

### Informations about the 2 implementations of the Information Retrieval Systems:
- #### There are differences in the time necessary to response to a query drifted by the Relevance Feedback algorithm
- #### This difference is caused by the difference in the search method
